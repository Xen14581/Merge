``attrs``: Classes Without Boilerplate
======================================


``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder <https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html>`_ methods).
`Trusted by NASA <https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-badge>`_ for Mars missions since 2020!

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. teaser-end

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import attr

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class SomeClass(object):
   ...     a_number = attr.ib(default=42)
   ...     list_of_numbers = attr.ib(factory=list)
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> attr.asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = attr.make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a complete set of comparison methods (equality and ordering),
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

On Python 3.6 and later, you can often even drop the calls to ``attr.ib()`` by using `type annotations <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/types.html>`_.

This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing ``tuple``\ s or `confusingly behaving <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#namedtuples>`_ ``namedtuple``\ s.
Which in turn encourages you to write *small classes* that do `one thing well <https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries>`_.
Never again violate the `single responsibility principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_ just because implementing ``__init__`` et al is a painful drag.

Release Information
===================

21.1.0 (2021-05-06)
-------------------

Deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The long-awaited, much-talked-about, little-delivered ``import attrs`` is finally upon us!

  Since the NG APIs have now been proclaimed stable, the **next** release of ``attrs`` will allow you to actually ``import attrs``.
  We're taking this opportunity to replace some defaults in our APIs that made sense in 2015, but don't in 2021.

  So please, if you have any pet peeves about defaults in ``attrs``'s APIs, *now* is the time to air your grievances in #487!
  We're not gonna get such a chance for a second time, without breaking our backward-compatibility guarantees, or long deprecation cycles.
  Therefore, speak now or forever hold you peace!
  `#487 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/487>`_
- The *cmp* argument to ``attr.s()`` and `attr.ib()` has been **undeprecated**
  It will continue to be supported as syntactic sugar to set *eq* and *order* in one go.

  I'm terribly sorry for the hassle around this argument!
  The reason we're bringing it back is it's usefulness regarding customization of equality/ordering.

  The ``cmp`` attribute and argument on ``attr.Attribute`` remains deprecated and will be removed later this year.
  `#773 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/773>`_


Changes
^^^^^^^

- It's now possible to customize the behavior of ``eq`` and ``order`` by passing in a callable.
  `#435 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/435>`_,
  `#627 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/627>`_
- The instant favorite `next-generation APIs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#next-gen>`_ are not provisional anymore!

  They are also officially supported by Mypy as of their `0.800 release <https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2021/01/mypy-0800-released.html>`_.

  We hope the next release will already contain an (additional) importable package called ``attrs``.
  `#668 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/668>`_,
  `#786 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/786>`_
- If an attribute defines a converter, the type of its parameter is used as type annotation for its corresponding ``__init__`` parameter.

  If an ``attr.converters.pipe`` is used, the first one's is used.
  `#710 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/710>`_
- Fixed the creation of an extra slot for an ``attr.ib`` when the parent class already has a slot with the same name.
  `#718 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/718>`_
- ``__attrs__init__()`` will now be injected if ``init=False``, or if ``auto_detect=True`` and a user-defined ``__init__()`` exists.

  This enables users to do "pre-init" work in their ``__init__()`` (such as ``super().__init__()``).

  ``__init__()`` can then delegate constructor argument processing to ``self.__attrs_init__(*args, **kwargs)``.
  `#731 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/731>`_
- ``bool(attr.NOTHING)`` is now ``False``.
  `#732 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/732>`_
- It's now possible to use ``super()`` inside of properties of slotted classes.
  `#747 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/747>`_
- Allow for a ``__attrs_pre_init__()`` method that -- if defined -- will get called at the beginning of the ``attrs``-generated ``__init__()`` method.
  `#750 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/750>`_
- Added forgotten ``attr.Attribute.evolve()`` to type stubs.
  `#752 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/752>`_
- ``attrs.evolve()`` now works recursively with nested ``attrs`` classes.
  `#759 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/759>`_
- Python 3.10 is now officially supported.
  `#763 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/763>`_
- ``attr.resolve_types()`` now takes an optional *attrib* argument to work inside a ``field_transformer``.
  `#774 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/774>`_
- ``ClassVar``\ s are now also detected if they come from `typing-extensions <https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/>`_.
  `#782 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/782>`_
- To make it easier to customize attribute comparison (#435), we have added the ``attr.cmp_with()`` helper.

  See the `new docs on comparison <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html>`_ for more details.
  `#787 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/787>`_
- Added **provisional** support for static typing in ``pyright`` via the `dataclass_transforms specification <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/master/specs/dataclass_transforms.md>`_.
  Both the ``pyright`` specification and ``attrs`` implementation may change in future versions of both projects.

  Your constructive feedback is welcome in both `attrs#795 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/795>`_ and `pyright#1782 <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/discussions/1782>`_.
  `#796 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/796>`_

`Full changelog <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html>`_.

Credits
=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `subclassing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
