Merge is a collaborative workspace addon for Github accounts.

Users can log in to the website using their Github accounts and access chats for each repository they have made or they are a collaborator in, regardless if they are public or private.

A ToDo is also available for every repository the user is a part of.

This is the backend of the website made using Django.

Frontend of the website can be found at https://github.com/itaxhi12/Merge-frontend-
